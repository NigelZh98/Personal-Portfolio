# Portfolio Website By Next JS

This is a portfolio website built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It showcases your skills, projects, and achievements in an elegant and responsive design.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/judygab/portfolio-website.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd portfolio-website`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the Website.

## Learn from this course:

Compared to the web project I did before, next.js is more of a truly dynamic website, and the language is more flexible than HTML. 
Compared with MYSQL, PHP and other languages, Next.js allows me to experience a more profound world of programming languages.
At the same time, in this Final group project, I found that it is not easy to complete a development project through cooperation between teams, especially the previous communication problems among team members are crucial.

That's the portfolio website ---<a href="https://localhost:3000/">Here</a>
